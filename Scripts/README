This folder containts all the scripts. They are based on bash and some python snipets.
Requires  - NACCESS
          - LIGHTDOCK (v 0.9.2_post1)
          - VOROMQA (v 1.21)
          - DockQ 
          - Jwalk (v 2.1)
          - pymol (2.3.4)

Scripts are ran 1 to 13, sequentially. Ideally, you wont find any issues. But if you do, please contact: gilberto.pereiraportugal@gmail.com

Additional info: The pymol align script can also be turned into a VMD alignment and you will get basically the same result.
The unbound monomers + ligands are superimposed on top of the predicted structure and then they are deleted, leaving the ligands in the pocket but without touching the coordinates of the solution. 
The idea is that the ligands (WARHEAD and RECRUITER) are transplanted to each predicted structure by aligning the monomers to the predictions using the C-alphas.

For Jwalk, we selected the anchor atom on each ligand AND we renamed that atom to CA (because Jwalk builds crosslinks between C-alphas of residues (LYS, TYR, THR, etc..) and used vox = 2 for efficiency (default is 1).
